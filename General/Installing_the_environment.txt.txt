For the programming exercises, we will be distributing Jupyter Notebooks.

There are a couple of ways to run Jupyter Notebooks, we provide two options:
 1. Install anaconda3 on your computer (if not already installed). You can download it on [1]. Once you have it installed
     a. You can launch the `Jupyter Notebook` or `Jupyter Lab` using the anaconda navigation panel (follow this instruction: [2][3]) or
     b  You can launch `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from your command prompt terminal (follow this instruction: [4][5]).
 2. Upload the Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab (see: [6][7])


Once you've been able to launch the Jupyter Notebook, you might also need to have a number of python packages installed. The easiest and (our) recommended way is to install anaconda3 (see instruction above). It comes pre-packaged with many scientific python packages, these packages are a superset of the onces we need, so you are already set if you have installed anaconda3.

If you prefer to manually install these python packages, you should ensure you have the following pacakages installed:

  - jupyterlab
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - ipython


Optional:
  - ipympl -> this allows you to display zoomable plots in the notebook.
